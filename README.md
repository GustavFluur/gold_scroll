# * Disclaimer: 
#  Unfortunately this project has led to undesired result than anticipated,
#  Due to lots of personal stress, recent sickness in flu and long days at work + scarce assistance from TUT support by all 90 minutes per week came to an end before submission did led to the work on this project hasn't reach its objective.
# I am well aware that this will led to absolute failure to its grading, yet I am coming with my frank words in beginning in this readme.md file so the exception isn't as high to start with to whom whoever is reading this message or scan the project itself for its features & orientation.

## Gold Scroll is a project that is based upon the project Boutique Ado - a walkthrough that demonstrates its value to create an e-commerce site and lots of its foundation is built upon to this one -> Gold Scroll
## What took a lot of time was set up of stripe and learning materials from Code Institute is quite obsolete since it was uploaded in about 3 years ago according to youtube publishing and a sense of lack features from stripe dashboard. 


## Left to implement:

- [ ]       add product
- [ ] 		update product 
- [ ] 		delete product 
- [ ]       payment into the app (using stripe) I would relay more on videos of walkthrough, 
            what I can see Is that you need to go to stripe dashboard create webhook with urls of your gitpod project (first setting up local webhook) and copy webhook secret key in the:           
            STRIPE_WH_SECRET variable (but its alll in detail explained in the walkthrough videos under stripe section)

		
- [ ] 		Make sure the form to add product is validated (be specific about what the users are sending through the form)
	
		
- [ ] 		Create a newsletter functionality
		
- [ ] 		A facebook page
		
- [ ] 		User profile feature
		
- [ ] 		Login/register
		
- [ ] 		Restrict non logged in users from accessing some pages and some functionalities like adding products, deleting and updating
		
- [ ] 		Include a sitemap on your application to allow search engine bot crawling - Meta up in the page. 
		
- [ ] 		Include a robots.txt file to control search engine bot crawling - Marketing elements 
		
- [ ] 		Use an Agile tool to manage the planning and implementation of all primary functionality


# Plus use Heroku & add them
