# Gold Scroll 


![Gold Scroll](documentation/readme/gold-scroll.png)


# * Disclaimer: 
###  Unfortunately this project has led to undesired result than anticipated,
###  Due to lots of personal stress, recent sickness in flu and long days at work + scarce assistance from TUT support by all 90 minutes per week came to an end before submission did led to the work on this project hasn't reach its objective.
### I am well aware that this will led to absolute failure to its grading, yet I am coming with my frank words in beginning in this readme.md file so the exception isn't as high to start with to whom whoever is reading this message or scan the project itself for its features & orientation.

### Gold Scroll is based upon Boutique Ado - a walkthrough project that demonstrates its value to create an e-commerce site and lots of its foundation is built upon to this one -> Gold Scroll.


## Reasons to this failure:

### Obsolete learning content from Code Institute 
- e.g. Allauth recent setup looks very differently compared to Boutique Ado, thus a confusing element. (After grading this will be deleted and another login or sign up pages will be created independently )
- Stripe has changed a lot since the video from Code Institute uploaded its learning video, yet,
     - Stripe is installed on the website it's shows that "payments" has been made yet:
        - I need to go to stripe dashboard create webhook with urls of your gitpod project (first setting up local webhook) and copy webhook secret key in the : STRIPE_WH_SECRET variable (but its all in detail explained in the walkthrough videos under stripe section)

- Due to some issues regarding the migrations I was forced to to delete the previous files on all the apps, guided by "Roman" on TuT support on Code Institute.

    - Thus the credit cart function is gone and it was seen before on the checkout page
    - It's an "arrow" that you use on the Merchandise list to direct you back on the top of the page, it's now gone since this technological failure occurred. 
   


# FEATURES:
- Lots of the features in this project is quite similar to Boutique Ado & thus another reason to this projects failure.
